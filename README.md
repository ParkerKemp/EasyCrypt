# EasyCrypt

EasyCrypt is an API layer that handles some basic cryptographic functions: creating public/private/secret keys and encrypting/decrypting messages with them.

Much of the code contained herein was shamelessly copied and pasted from StackOverflow. Modifications were made throughout to suit the needs of the SpinalcraftManager server and client.
